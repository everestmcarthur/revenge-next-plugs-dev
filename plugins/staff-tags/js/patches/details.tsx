/**
 * Covers member list rows and the profile popout, where the name and tag sit on the same line.
 *
 * Multiple distinct `UserRow` implementations can exist in the same build (member list vs.
 * profile popout, etc.), so this subscribes rather than doing a single lookup - `max` is a guess
 * and may need adjusting once verified live, see eval-for-revenge.
 *
 * `UserRow` is real but `React.memo()`-wrapped (confirmed live via a memo-patching sweep) - a
 * plain `withName('UserRow')` can never match it, since the wrapper object has no `.name` of its
 * own (only the memo-hidden inner function does). `withMemoDefaultName` (`../lib/filters`) checks
 * the wrapper's inner `.type.name` instead and matches on the full module namespace, so the
 * callback below receives `{default: <memo wrapper>}` - `mod.default` is the exact reference
 * Discord's own `createElement(UserRow, ...)` calls use, which is what `afterJSX` needs.
 *
 * Does NOT patch the memo wrapper's shared inner `.type` via `@revenge-mod/patcher`'s generic
 * `after()` (tried and confirmed live to be unsound - see git history on this file). That's true
 * even for a single, non-stacking, persistent `after()` call: wrapping the shared render function
 * in `after()`'s Proxy broke member list rendering outright, every time, even on a fully fresh app
 * process with nothing else patched. Whatever `after()` does to make a target "patchable" doesn't
 * survive contact with this particular shared function.
 *
 * Instead, `afterJSX(wrapper, el => ...)` intercepts each `createElement(UserRow, props)` call
 * (the per-instance element, never the shared object) and does a **plain, unwrapped property
 * assignment** - `el.type = patchedRender` - to a single stable function reused for every row
 * (defined once, outside the `afterJSX` callback, not a fresh closure per row). `patchedRender`
 * manually calls the real inner render function itself (`innerRender(props)`, safe to call
 * directly - React only ever needs the dispatcher active, and it is, since `patchedRender` itself
 * is invoked *by* React as `el`'s render function), then augments the returned tree. This avoids
 * `after()`'s Proxy machinery entirely while still landing a plain, always-callable function
 * (never the non-callable memo wrapper) on `element.type`, so it doesn't hit the earlier
 * "TypeError: target is not callable" crash either. Reusing the same function reference across
 * every row (rather than a fresh closure per element) keeps `element.type` identity stable across
 * re-renders, letting React reconcile these rows normally instead of remounting each one.
 *
 * `UserRow` renders a single `TableRow` whose name+tag live at `ret.props.label` (a `View`) as a
 * **prop**, not somewhere reachable by a generic "find array children containing a string"
 * search - that mismatch (not the render-output shape itself) is why tags never appeared even
 * before the crash: `findInReactFiber` was searching for a shape that doesn't exist in this tree.
 * `label.props.children` is `[nameElement, fragment, existingTagElement]` - confirmed live via
 * `/root/evals-for-rn` - where `existingTagElement` is Discord's own `BotTag` component with a
 * static `.Types` enum and a numeric `type` prop; ordinary members render it already, with
 * `type: 0` (an inactive placeholder, not the "BOT" badge that enum value name suggests). Kept
 * `existingTag.props?.type !== 0` as a guard against stacking our own tag next to a real built-in
 * badge (bot/official/system), but dropped the old "mutate `existingTag`'s props in place" path
 * entirely - confirmed live that `BotTag` derives its displayed label purely from the `type`
 * enum (via the same module's `getBotLabel`), ignoring any custom `text`/color props entirely, so
 * that branch silently did nothing. Always injecting our own plugin-authored `GradientTag`
 * instead (confirmed live to actually render custom text/color) is the only path that works;
 * `GradientTag` already branches on its own `gradientColor` prop for solid-vs-gradient, so there's
 * no need for the old `TagModule` (Discord's `BotTag` module again, same dead end) fallback.
 *
 * Uses `getModules` (reacts once Discord itself initializes the module) instead of
 * `lookupModule` (which force-initializes uninitialized modules right away) - forcing UserRow to
 * init during `start()`, before Discord is done booting, is what crashed app startup the first
 * time this shipped.
 *
 * Every callback below is wrapped in `guard()`: it runs whenever Discord itself renders/
 * initializes the matched module, not inside `applyPatches`' try/catch, which only covers the
 * synchronous setup calls - an uncaught throw here would otherwise skip a row's tag at best, or
 * (per the shared-target lesson above) risk destabilizing every row's rendering at worst.
